Halloween
=========

Halloween decorations from a number of sources
Basically this repository has code for 
** An Arduino-controlled skull with a working, servo-controlled, jaw and red LEDs in the eye sockets and in the mouth. 
** An Arduino-controlled Wav player that plays through a bunch of wavs. It seems to play them pretty randomly, perhaps not
** A demon rat on an OpenBuilds V-rail gantry that is belt-driven, stepper-motor powered.
** The Demon Rat itself has Neopixel eyes and mouth inserted into it's interior. They eyes glow brightly and alternate colors.
